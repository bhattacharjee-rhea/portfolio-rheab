# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Interview Plan
**Hunch**: What would make people who don't use social media (like me) want to use it? 

**Interview Subjects**
1. High school student with lots of social media experience, uses social media on a daily basis. Useful subject for the point of view of someone who was raised with social media and incorporates it into their everyday life.
2. College student who has social media but does not use it socially, they represent a good perspective into how people use social media beyond interacting with people they know online.

**Possible Questions**:
1. Basic information: what social media platforms do you use? How often do you use them? What is the most common thing you do on social media? How long do you spend on social media per day, on average?
2. When you open the social media app/website/etc, what is the first thing you look at? What is your normal routine?
3. When do you get an account? Why did you decide to get an account?

## Interview 1
Conducted over FaceTime, audio recorded.

    <ul>
        <li> Instagram, linkedin, mostly lurking on instagram. Used everyday, like an hour per day</li>
        <li> Look at other people’s stories on instagram, look at other people’s posts, look people up, and look at for you feed</li>
        <li> Look at celebrities on instagram, scroll through their content, to know more about a person and their life</li>
        <li>On linkedin find requests for people to grow their network, people from high school only</li>
        <li>First thing on insta is look at friends’ stories, only look at stories of ten people they know the best, ignore the rest</li>
        <li>Look at the stories of people on interest, anyone from their school, like a former classmate going to college</li>
        <li>First check insta DMs, then view stories, then scroll through posts, then check explore feed</li>
        <li>On explore feed, trusts the algorithm find new stuff, algorithm is very “brain-sucking,” can fall for clickbait, try to avoid clickbait to avoid getting it</li>
        <li>Explore feed shows personality, considers it more private than seeing someone naked</li>
        <li>Spends a lot of time during the day on the explore feed, goes down rabbit hole many times</li>
        <li>When looking at people, look at their posts, won’t follow unless they know them in person. Don’t like requesting to follow people they don’t know, considers it poor etiquette</li>
        <li>Got instagram in middle school because they were running for class president and then kept going because it was considered normal. Puts time into it because everyone else does, considers it valued in society. Finds value in having a network of people.</li>
        <li>Prefers not to post, considers social media as a form of signaling, subconscious representation of who a person is. Can tell what kind of person someone is from their posts</li>
        <li>Don’t like looking at LinkedIn posts because it’s significantly more fake, spends much less time on linkedin because there is nothing to do</li>
        <li>Only DM people that they text, respond to stories through DMs</li>
        <li>Considers follower/following ratio for how important a person looks</li>
        <li>Instagram is a good way to keep track of what other people are doing, posting stuff to inform other people of daily life</li>
        <li>Not interested in other platforms because doesn’t really care for thoughts as much as updates on people’s lives</li>
        <li>Doesn’t like using instagram, but feels programmed to do so, doesn’t feel like missing out when out of the loop but doesn’t want to send a message that they have blocked others when they disable they account</li>
        <li>Does like to keep track of other people’s lives (short term impulses). Does not like explore page or that it is a normal thing to do. Considers it a bad habit.</li>
    </ul>

Interviewee 1 does not have a lot of social media accounts and is most active on Instagram. They are on Instagram because it is the normal thing to do, something that their friends and everyone around them does, so they think it’s weird for someone to not be active on their instagram. However, they have a significantly more complicated relationship with social media. They hate going on Instagram. They don’t like that they are addicted to the short term happiness that social media provides and said verbatim that they were happier when they left social media. However, they do not want to permanently leave social media because of the message that departure would send to the people around them.

They discussed the social capital surrounding social media and how they appreciated the intentionality of the spaces users curate. They liked the fact that people could deliberately present themselves to the world, and enjoyed trying to use what people posted to determine what type of person the poster really is. They also mentioned enjoying having the network they built and having tangible connections to people who passed through their lives. They “like the existence” of social media but don’t like using it, even while they feel compelled to do so.

## Interview 2
Conducted over Discord call, audio recorded.

Interviewee 2 did not have a broad variety of social media but was active on two very different platforms: Twitter and Tumblr. They do not use social media to interact with people they know but to instead engage mostly with strangers on the internet. They currently heavily curate their social media experience, only following users whose posts they have vetted in order to avoid takes they dislike. This allows them to get political news on Twitter and engage in fandom content on Tumblr without harming their mental health.

Interviewee 2 made a very good point regarding why they got into social media in the first place. They were very into a specific band, and noted the band would not “post updates in the Washington Post or New York Times.” Staying in the loop is a notable benefit of social media. Since they heavily curate the content they see for the sake of their mental health, they might be happier if they quit social media, but the tradeoff is that they would be less informed. Interview 2 also raises the idea of using different social media platforms for different purposes based on how they were designed and who the user base is. This goes as far as presenting completely different faces (unrelated accounts) and different personas on the two sites in order to get different experiences from them.

## Design Opportunities
- **Privacy**: Specifically for statistics such as follower count. Should this be made public or not? Private follower accounts avoid a "popularity contest," which users such as Interviewee 2 prefer. On the other hand, Interviewee 1 prefers the popularity contest model as a descriptor of the person to whom the account belongs. Choosing which model to follow would drastically impact the user base of the social media platform, attracting different types of people.

- **Personalization**: How does an app determine what content gets recommended in order to avoid content the user doesn't want to see? How does the app balance this with internet safety such as data privacy concerns? Interviewee 2 spends a lot of time actively curating content and interviewee 1 tries to manipulate their explore page but follows the algorithm. A possible area of design is determining how an app should choose which content and users to display to the user when the user decides to explore the app. This "explore page" needs to find new content but also avoid reaching too far and displaying content a user does not want to see. A good exploration page would definitely make the app more approachable to new users.

- **Connecting with people**: Should the platform encourage anonymity or encourage personal connection? Depending on the aims of the site, having one or the other would attract different people. A site that is more anonymous would encourage more discussion, for better or for worse, more in line with Interviewee 2’s use of social media. However, connecting accounts to people promotes more human connection, which is one of the few things Interviewee 1 appreciates about social media.
