# Cognitive Walkthrough: National Air and Space Museum

Although most of the Smithsonian museums are walk-in, the Air and Space museum is undergoing renovations and requires (free) passes to enter. I decided to do a walkthrough of the ticket buying process to see how intuitive it is to do.

```
How easily can a user...
1. know they need to do something?
2. notice the correct action is available, and associate it with what they're trying to do?
3. based on what occurs after the action is taken, know that it was the right thing to
have done?
4. understand how they've made progress towards their larger goal?
```

Entering the website there is a big red button at the very top to reserve passes:

<img src="../img/blog%20posts/13_header.png" alt="banner" />

I think it does a good job of getting the point across. Once you click on the button to reserve passes, the website sends an alert:

<img src="../img/blog%20posts/13_alert.png" alt="alert" width="50%" />

I don’t think this is the best design: the inclusion of an alert generally means that something went wrong. It might be better to have a separate confirmation screen instead.

Is the booking screen intuitive? To someone who has booked museum tickets before it is, as it follows the same script. A user sees a highlighted dropdown asking them to select the time they want:

<img src="../img/blog%20posts/13_time.png" alt="select time" width="50%" />

After which the button to confirm activates. If a user wants to pick a different date, they have to select a different day on the calendar, which changes the color:

<img src="../img/blog%20posts/13_calendar.png" alt="select date" width="50%" />

I think that if you’ve had previous experience with similar ticket booking websites it is easy enough to understand, but otherwise it might not be intuitive to click the calendar.

Once you confirm the day and time, you are sent to another page where you select the number of tickets you want. You then get sent to a confirmation page, and finally the order page, where you enter your information and get the tickets. These last pages are easy enough to click through: they follow a very similar script to any other shopping site. 

I think this is a pretty good design! It’s far from the worst museum site I’ve seen. When I used it for the first time—on my phone driving to the museum because I’d forgotten to get tickets earlier— I was able to get tickets without problem.
