# Serif vs Sans-Serif Fonts

Lecture 12 mentioned typography and the difference between serifs and sans-serif fonts. To briefly recap, serif fonts have extra strokes on the letters known as ‘serifs’ while sans-serif fonts do not. I was curious about the difference between them so I decided to do a bit of research comparing the two.

## The Vibes

The obvious difference, mentioned in lecture, is the “mood” of the font. Serif fonts tend to be more elegant while sans-serif fonts look more modern. I think a better distinction might be that serif fonts give a more “printed” look than sans-serif fonts. This isn’t the historical case— sans-serif fonts first appeared in the early 1800s and were used in newspapers from then onwards. But serif fonts still have that sense of formality that comes with printing. The best example of this is news websites, which use serif fonts. These websites don’t seem more elegant compared to websites using sans-serif fonts, but the use of serif fonts draws more attention to the text itself and gives it that much more weight.

## The Readability 

This is where things get murkier. Some sources say that serif fonts are easier to read because the serifs guide the reader when reading. However, as mentioned in lecture, there really isn’t any scientific proof to support this. There are advantages to serifs in legibility— l and I (lowercase L and uppercase I) are significantly easier to distinguish in the serif font I wrote this in as compared to the sans-serif font this will display in. I think this ties back to the idea of using serif fonts for printing— more distinguishable letters means more readable blocks of text. Sans-serif fonts, on the other hand, seem to work better at lower resolution as that makes serifs harder to render.

## The Accessibility 

Something else I ran into when looking into this was the relationship between fonts and dyslexia readability. This is, like the rest of the topic, pretty unclear. The prevailing idea is that sans-serif fonts are better for readability, but research is mixed. I do think that this is an important topic to keep in mind, however: being aware that there is more to fonts than just the vibes.
