# Design That Matters II: Social Impact

The second lecture on Design That Matters raised an interesting point about social impact and how companies should go beyond a token effort to do good. Instead, responsible innovation and positive impact should be built into the structure of the company. The idea of the “social impact gold standard” is interesting because of how it addresses the tension that can arise between “doing good” and “making money.” I think this tension is omnipresent in the current economic environment, which is why the whole idea of “greenwashing” is so common. The discussion of the social impact standard ended up reminding me of a pretty famous instance of where “doing good” and “making money” were placed in conflict: the [Volkswagen “Dieselgate” scandal](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34324772). 

I think what surprised me the most when I went back to look into it was how brazen the scandal was. Basically cheating through emissions tests using illegal software involves more than the company executives — it requires an entire chain of people, from the executives to the managers to the engineers, to actively implement the cheating. This goes back to the image of the iceberg of responsible innovation Lyel showed during the lecture: “doing good” goes deeper than just the technology into the organization and the structure of the company. [This is an interesting article](https://ideas.darden.virginia.edu/vw-emissions-and-the-3-factors-that-drive-ethical-breakdown) from the University of Virginia that discusses how such a breach of ethics could even occur in the first place. As part of the fallout of the scandal, Volkswagen has attempted to [change the company culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/business/volkswagen-emissions-regulations-reform.html). 

When “doing good” and “making money” come into conflict, like with Volkswagen, “making money” tends to win. This is why I find the idea of the “social impact gold standard” so interesting, because by aligning social value and economic value, the chance of conflict decreases.
