# Design That Matters

During the lecture, Lyel shared the quote “direction is more important than speed.” I thought this quote was really interesting because I feel like it encapsulates this entire class. From a very basic standpoint, it is incredibly tempting to start a project (of any size) and jump immediately into the code. This class, and the concept of design as a whole, challenges that notion. From the very beginning, designing software does not exist in a vacuum. The choices designers make (and, sometimes more importantly, the choices designers don’t make) will impact users in ways those designers might not anticipate. 

I think this raises the question of to whom software designers have an obligation. There is obviously the idea that designers have the primary obligation to the organization they work for, which implies that designers should prioritize the values of that organization. In this model, it would be up to the organization to set the values, and in the case of Responsible Innovation, set the values for more ethical design. 

I think this is a pretty lazy framework, and not even true in some cases. In the example given in Wednesday’s lecture, about Project Maven, grassroots organizing among employees changed the organizational behavior. So, what are the obligations of a software designer? I think that, as this class teaches, all designers have some obligation to Responsible Innovation and the doctrine of doing no harm. However, I do believe an interesting question to consider is what tension exists between the obligation to the organization and the obligation to the public at large.
